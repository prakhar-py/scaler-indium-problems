**Question 1:**
Consider the following table showing website traffic for the first three months of the year:

| Month    | Unique Visitors | Page Views |
| :------- | :-------------- | :--------- |
| January  | 10,000          | 30,000     |
| February | 12,000          | 33,000     |
| March    | 11,000          | 35,000     |

Which statement accurately describes a trend shown in the table?
A) Unique visitors consistently increased each month.
B) Page views consistently decreased each month.
C) The average page views per unique visitor was highest in January.
D) Page views increased from January to March, despite a dip in unique visitors in March.

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Unique visitors increased from Jan to Feb, then decreased in March. Page views increased from Jan to Feb, and again from Feb to March.
Average page views: Jan (30k/10k = 3), Feb (33k/12k = 2.75), March (35k/11k = 3.18). So C is incorrect. Statement D accurately reflects the data for page views and unique visitors.

**Question 2:**
A bar chart displays the monthly sales figures for a product over a year. If the bars for July, August, and September are noticeably taller than the bars for all other months, what is the most likely interpretation?
A) The product experienced its lowest sales during the summer months.
B) The product has a seasonal peak in sales during the summer.
C) The cost of producing the product was highest in the summer.
D) There was a data recording error for the summer months.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Taller bars in a sales chart typically represent higher sales figures. If July, August, and September consistently show higher sales than other months, it indicates a seasonal trend where sales peak during that period (summer in the northern hemisphere).

**Question 3:**
A company's revenue increased by 15% from Year 1 to Year 2. During the same period, its operational costs increased by 10%. Assuming the company was profitable in Year 1, what can be logically concluded about its profit in Year 2 compared to Year 1?
A) Profit definitely decreased.
B) Profit definitely remained the same.
C) Profit likely increased, but it's not guaranteed without knowing the actual revenue and cost figures.
D) Profit definitely increased.

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** If revenue (income) grows at a faster percentage rate than costs, and the company was initially profitable (Revenue > Costs), then the absolute increase in revenue will be greater than the absolute increase in costs, leading to an increase in profit (Profit = Revenue - Costs).
Example: Y1: R=100, C=50, P=50.
Y2: R=115 (15% up), C=55 (10% up), P=60. Profit increased.
This holds as long as the initial profit margin allows the percentage differences to work this way. Given "Easy" difficulty, a direct conclusion is expected. If R=100, C=90, P=10. R_new=115, C_new=99. P_new=16. Still an increase.
